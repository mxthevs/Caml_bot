## What this is?

Caml_bot is a Twitch.tv chatbot for my channel [matheusdev1](https://twitch.tv/matheusdev1) there! ü§ó

## What does it do?

  1. It have its own very performatic IRC Client, with **zero** third-party dependencies and built completely from scratch.
  2. It parses incoming messages from chat to a nice fully typed format.
  3. It has a full (opinionated) command parser, making it easy to configure, create and deploy new commands, without having to touch source.
  4. It can have public and mod-only commands.
